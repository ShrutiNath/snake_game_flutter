## flutter_snake_game

In our snake game, the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger and faster. The game ends if the snake crashes into the boundaries. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.
